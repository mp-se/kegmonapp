# KegMonApp - Companion app for kegmon

This is an addon for the Kegmon project. This acts as an installable web application (PWA) that can fetch and display data from any kegmon installation. 

> Requires v0.7 or newer or the web browser will block access due to CORS. 

The application is shipped as a docker image to allow for installation or access.

> Due to security limitation in all browsers the installation needs to be done via http:// since the kegmon does not support SSL. Its not allowed to install the app via SSL and then access non SSL resources.
